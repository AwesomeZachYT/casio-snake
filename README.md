# casio-snake
A game of snake made for the CASIO fx-9860G series.
I made this game as a fun mini-project after I got my first calculator. It's very simple, but just as addicting as the original.

## Importing onto a calculator

This game has only been compiled for calculators of the fx-9860G series, so make sure you have the proper calculator before attempting this. There is an entire fandom built around Casio calculators, so for more information, visit [Planet Casio](https://www.planet-casio.com). To do this, you will also need the USB mini-B, which is a legacy cable not to be confused with micro-USBs.

First, plug in your mini-B cable from your Casio into your computer. Your Casio might ask you to select a connection mode. If it does, press F1 to select `USB FLASH`. If it doesn't give you a prompt, go to the `LINK` application on your Casio and press F2.

Once you've connected your Casio, go to your PC and download [Snake.g1a](https://github.com/AwesomeZachYT/casio-snake/raw/refs/heads/main/Snake.g1a) on this Github. Now drag the downloaded file into your Casio hard drive, just like you would do on a regular USB.

Finally, eject the Casio hard drive. Once your Casio has updated its memory, you should see an application called `Snake` on your home page.
